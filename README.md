# CAP-5625-Computational-Foundations-of-Artificial-Intelligence
This course covers the mathematical and programming foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) using contemporary programming languages and tools. As a result, students develop familiarity with mathematical methods (and associated notation, software packages and libraries) that are widely used in AI and ML projects and literature

## **My work extends to following projects and research:**

- **Assignment 1-1:** Using python and numpy libraries, build an L2 linear ridge regression algorithm with batch gradient descent and 5 K-fold cross validation from scratch

- **Assignment 1-2:** Using python with sci-kit learn libraries, build an L2 linear ridge regression algorithm with batch gradient descent and 5 K-fold cross validation.

- **Assignment 2-1:** Using python and numpy libraries, build a penalized (regularized)  least  squares  fit  of  a  linear  model  using  elastic  net,  with  the  model  parameters  obtained by coordinate descent with 5 K-fold cross validation algorithm from scratch

- **Assignment 2-2:** Using python with sci-kit learn libraries, build a penalized (regularized)  least  squares  fit  of  a  linear  model  using  elastic  net,  with  the  model  parameters  obtained by coordinate descent with 5 K-fold cross validation algorithm.

- **Assignment 3-1:** Using python and numpy libraries, build an penalized Logistic regression algorithm with batch gradient descent and grid search 5 K-fold cross validation from scratch

- **Assignment 3-2:** Using python with sci-kit learn libraries, build an penalized Logistic regression algorithm with batch gradient descent and grid search 5 K-fold cross validation.

- **Survey Topic:** Write a 10 page survey on: General game play with reinforcement learning

- **Summary on lecture 1:** Industry lecture summary 1 (Dr. Mihai Fonoage)

- **Summary on lecture 2:** Industry lecture summary 2 (Dr. David Jaramillo)
